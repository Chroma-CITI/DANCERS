# DANCERS
DANCERS is a co-simulator suited for multi-robot simulation. It merges any multi-robot simulator with any network simulator to enable the study of Networked Multi-Robot Systems (NMRS).


The documentation for DANCERS can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Chroma-CITI/DANCERS/wiki). It includes installation instructions and tutorials of increasing complexity showing what can be done with DANCERS.

DANCERS was first included in [a conference paper at SIMPAR 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979148).
